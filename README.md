# DeJac_Michael_Dojo_Sweeper

A version of minesweeper.  Initial model was a 10x10 grid provided by Coding Dojo as a practice item in the Alogrithm section of Web Fundamentals.
Complete gameplay functionality implemented by me.

Future to do's:

  Add timer
  Add bomb counter and implement win condition if all bombs succesfully marked
  Add hold right click to see all connected tiles.
  Add hold right click, left click to remove numbered tiles that have had their bombs successfully marked.
